##*Questions and Reflections*
1. The order of emphasis and header: figured out that header code should go first and then emphasis
2. This assignment is quite interesting. I went back to the installation steps before to help myself remember and then start new steps.Also, besides steps on Github website of Markdown, it could also work from R Markdown.
