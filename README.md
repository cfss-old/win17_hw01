Also you can visit my GitHub [here](https://github.com/pohyuquan).

##How I got my changes onto GitHub:

1. First I **forked** the HW repository.
2. Next I **cloned** the forked repository onto my computer using RStudio.
  * Created a new project in RStudio using version control (Git) and pasted the URL for my forked repository.
3. I modified the *README.md* file in RStudio using Markdown Syntax as indicated by Github (found [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
4. I committed my changes and added a message "modified README" to indicate my changes.
5. I pulled from GitHub using the "Git" tab in RStudio to update my local repository.
6. I pushed my changes to GitHub through RStudio in the same "Git" tab as before.

##Reflections
The process of cloning a repository and making local changes before committing it and pushing it was fairly straight forward as I referenced the steps indicated through the CFSS "General Homework Guidelines" page (found [here](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw00_homework_guidelines.html#homework_workflow)). Although I had previously used a different command interface (*cygwin*), it took some getting used to in order to learn how to perform the similar commands on RStudio.
