#### Reflection on workflow  
I've had some experience using git and github, so I used the terminal for parts of the process.  I first forked the repository from the class's github page.  Next, I opened the terminal on my local machine and cloned the form by executing the command "git clone <HTTP repo on github>".  Next I opened up the file README.md in RStudio and creted a new project from my existing directory.  I made changes localy to the file in RStudio.  Finally, when I finished the assignment I commited my changes and pushed to my forked repository.
