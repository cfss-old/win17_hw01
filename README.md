Hello all (or should I say 'Hello World'?),

I'm an international student from The Bahamas(see islands in yellow below).

<img src="http://i.infopls.com/images/mbahama.gif" width="350" height="350" />

I'm currently in the MAPSS Program. I did my undergrad at home in psychology and am still focusing on psych at UChicago. 

My interests cover:

- Cognitive Neuroscience

- Language

    - Bilingualism
  
    - Linguistic Relativity

Basically, I'm interested in how language affects how we experience the world and I think one of the best ways to understand experience is by studying the brain. 

I get to explore these interests as an RA in the [Expereince and Cognition Lab](http://www.casasanto.com/).

A lot of the work being done in cognitive science uses programming, at the very least for data analysis. I'm hoping to gain programming and data science experience so that I can broaden my research possibilities and present myself as an asset to current and future labs.

Looking forward to a productive quarter.

**Alex**
