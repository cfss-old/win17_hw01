# Process #

In completing this assignment I consulted the following tutorial for a majority of the procedure: http://cfss.uchicago.edu/git05.html#make_sure_rstudio_can_find_git

After installing the appropiate programs by following this tutorial (http://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup00.html) I first forked the HW1 repo on Github. From there, I started a new project on Rstudio and connected it to a repository already on Github (the one I just forked for myself). After this I opened up the README.md file in Rstudio  where I was able to edit the file directly in the field. During editing I used this tutorial (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to insert markdown code and create my biography page. I created a heading, a short paragraph with emphasis on some words, a list of my favorite TV shows, as well as links in this paragraph. From there I saved the file and "Commit" it. From there I pushed the file using the Git tab in Rstudio. Finally I requested a pull on github.
