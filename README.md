# hw01
Repository for first CFSS homework assignment

##This is self introduction of Yanning!

I am a **MAPSS** student and my concentration is *Sociology*.

My research interest is computational content analysis using Twitter API.

To be specific,

- Twitter users' attitudes(**emotions** and **sentiments**) toward a specific event
- Patterns of attitudes over an amount of time:
   1.by region(the user's location)
   2.by gender

##Enough academics!
> I also love cooking and enjoy music!

##Description
I followed this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to use markdown and make essential changes to readme.md.It took me a while to download MacTex (for exporting pdf R markdown files for future use), and restart R, and open a R Markdown file.
I tried both markdown(.md) and R markdown(.Rmd), and results are the same.I also debug my scripts, and preview pdf/knit pdf to preview the result.

I tried this [tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/r-markdown.html) to resize the image, but still couldn't get it inserted right after the text in the perfect size. 

Because I have used GitHub before, in another class last quarter, so I am quite familiar with git clone, commit, push, etc.
