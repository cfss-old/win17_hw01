# Report
I created a new project from version control and pulled from github using git pull command. Then I modified the markdown file in Rstudio. 

The hard problem is to find out the R Markdown code seems to require blank line before the list in order for list syntax to work properly. Trying to understand how commit and push work is also the harder part. The other parts are relatively easy.
