Hi, my name is Nora and I am a Ph.D. student taking this class to learn more about programming and statistics. For my master's project two years ago, I studied how stress affects decision making, by bringing subjects into the lab, stressing them out (very rude, I know), measuring their hormone levels, and looking at their performance on decision making tasks. I had to self-teach myself in EPrime in order to create computer decision making tasks for my participants to take. I really enjoyed learning to code and program in EPrime, but even EPrime has the "click and drag" meantality similar to that of SPSS. I hope to use this class to learn more about the programming behind the tasks I'm creating and the statistical analyses that I'm using.

### Bio

*I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago, working in the Behavioral Biology Lab under Dr. Dario Maestripieri. My general research interests include the neuroendocrine bases of human decision-making and cooperation, behavioral and biological responsiveness to social stimuli and psychosocial stress, and individual differences in behavior in relation to sex and stress hormones.*

### Report of Process


To make this file, I first forked the repo for homework 1. Then, I opened an RStudio project using the link from this forked repo (cloning the forked repo from my homework repo and opening it in RStudio / Git Client in R).
