#### How I made this.
These are the steps I took to make this file:

1. First, I forked the hw01 repo.

2. Then, I created a new project in RStudio > Version Control > Git, and used the URL of the forked hw01 github repository as the repository URL.

3. Then I wrote a brief biography of myself as instructed, and began describing how I did everything.

4. After this, I will commit my changes, push back to github, and then submit a pull request on the original hw01 repo.
