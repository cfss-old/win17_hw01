#About me

I'm Xiangyu Ma, a first-year PhD student in the University of Chicago ~~Philosophy~~, no, **Sociology** department. I came here straight out of undergrad. 

##Brief life history

Born in Nanjing, China, I emigrated to Singapore when I was four. I grew up in Singapore, then: where I went to primary school, secondary school, junior college, and where I had to serve two years of compulsory military service. I did my undergrad at [Pomona College](http://www.pomona.edu), in Claremont, California. It's a lovely little place â€” an idyllic town of "elms and PhDs" on the fringe of Los Angeles County.![Pomona College, Claremont CA.](https://www.pomona.edu/sites/default/files/images/articles/twitterphoto.jpg)
