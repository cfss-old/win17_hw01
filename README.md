## Making this page
Setting up everything on Git and RStudio was easy since I had used them previously. 
I used the guide on [this page](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/git05.html) to clone the GitHub repository for homework 1 via RStudio.
For using Markdown, [this GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) was helpful.
At first I couldn't figure out how to preview my Markdown file, but then I followed the instructions on [this page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to install the R Markdown package, which opened up the "Preview HTML" option in RStudio.
