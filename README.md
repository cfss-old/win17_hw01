## About me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Name**: Yinyuan (Sean) Zheng

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Major**: _MAPSS_ with a focus in _Pschology_ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Research Interests**: My current research is about analogical reasoning in children.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Motive for taking the class**: I want to be formally trained on R and learn skills like visualization and webdesign.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Trivia**: I'm thinking using this image as my Github avatar. :thinking:

- [ ] A smart way to do indention (see __Reflections__)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the [online markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), I use markdown syntax to incorporate the elements listed in the [hw guide](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw01_edit-README.html). Markdown is easy to use where simple texts are typed as in a Word document. Complex functions such as including codes and outputs would be done through advanced R Markdown. 

## Reflections
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The online guides and [workflow instruction](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw00_homework_guidelines.html#homework_workflow) are extremely helpful for step-by-step learning and submitting. One problem I had is to create separate paragraphs. It is not enough to only hit __ENTER__ once but instead twice, leaving an empty line inbetween two sentences in Rstudio. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I found it is hard to do good indention in markdown. The current approach I took is to combine and type &+n+b+s+p+; before the first sentence of a paragraph, which translates into spaces. 
    
    Tabbing or simply adding spaces before the first sentence would look like this. 
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to know more about efficient indention.
